1. Write a class named “MyCmdPgm”. The class should implement two methods
a.    First method “ClimbStairs” is a recursive method which gives the possible number of ways to climb stairs considering that the user can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. The method takes in a single integer value ‘n’ as parameter, which is the number of stairs. For example:
If n=4 there are 5 ways of climbing the stairs
1,1,1,1   2,1,1   1,2,1   1,1,2   2,2
ClimbStairs(4) will return an integer value 5.
b.    Second method “MagicSigil” takes a string and removes its vowels and duplicate letters. The returned string should not contain any spaces and be in uppercase. For duplicate letters the last one is kept. For example
MagicSigil ("i am healthy”) will return back “MLTHY”
 Use switch case in the program and use command line argument for choice of    function to be implemented. For example:
 java MyCmdPgm 1 would invoke first method “ClimbStairs”.

2. Write a class called Savings_Account with following variables
protected int accountnumber
protected double balance
protected double rate
and create three parameterised constructors and use “this” keyword in two of them. 
The methods are public void deposit (double amount)to deposit a given amount, 
public boolean checkminbalance() checks if minimum balance is available or not, 
You need to maintain Rs.1000 as minimum balance in your account. 
public boolean withdrawal (double amount) which returns true if withdrawal is 
possible else false, call the method ”checkminbalance” using ”this” keyword . 
Make required modifications in the “balance” variable. 
public void add_interest() method adds interest based on the “rate” variable.
Create an array of 10 objects. 
Validations required : Ensure that the “accountnumber” is unique
