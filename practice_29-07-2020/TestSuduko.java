 *2.	Sudoku is a mathematical puzzle based on a 9 x 9 matrix. 
 *This matrix is subdivided into 3 x 3 submatrices. The aim of the
 *game is to complete a partial filled matrix with numbers from 
 *1 to 9 such that every number occurs exactly once in every row,
 *column und 3 x 3 submatrix. With backtracking all combinations
 *can be systematically found.
 *
 *To decide efficiently whether a new number is allowed to place in a field,
 *you should think of an data structure with which for a given row r and 
 *column c the nubmer z can be placed into the field or not. This data 
 *structure is similiar to the one used for the eight queens problem.
